*__<Control+F1>__* - Maximize program from tray  
*__<Control+e>__* - Edit an existing entry  
*__<Control+o>__* - Open a link (the entry must be of link type and contain a link in the content.  
Alternatively, copy the file content to the clipboard (the file must be located in .\\files\\filename, and the filename must be specified in the entry content))

Tags can be added by separating them with the # symbol for searching as well.  
You can print #- to exclude entry with this tag  

You can navigate between the input field and the list using the up and down keys. 

While in the list, you can start typing a tag or delete a tag using backspace
